                <h1>STERNS</h1>
                <p>Austrian immigrant, Joseph Stern believed that with the combination of quality and craftsmanship, one could create the perfect piece of jewellery. So, when he opened the very first Sterns store in Johannesburg in 1896, this was one of his core values. Now more than 115 years later, the Sterns brand still holds on to that very philosophy.

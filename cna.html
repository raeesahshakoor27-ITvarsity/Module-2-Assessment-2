                <h1>CNA</h1>
                <p>CNA has 168 stores countrywide and has embarked on a 5 year growth plan focussed on smaller store/shop sizes in convenient locations to better serve the broader South African customer.
                <br><br>
                We continue with our strategy of being your favourite stationery store. Stationery, our category killer dominates in our stores with a full spectrum of stationery across scholastic, home office and fashionable on trend items. In addition, there is a renewed focus in our Arts and Crafts ranges with a dramatically improved and increased offer to our customers.
                <br><br>
                Our secondary strategic focus remains Education. While we currently dominate the market with our study guides, the team is currently working on a comprehensive ECD (Education Child Development) range across the various life and learning stages of children with the involvement of Occupational Therapists and other subject matter experts in the industry.</p>

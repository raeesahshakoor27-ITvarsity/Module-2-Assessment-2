                <h1>STEERS</h1>
                <p>Steers is South Africa’s leading flame-grilled burger brand that has been serving “real food made real good” to South Africans for over 50 years. Testament to our great tasting food is the fact that we have won the “leisure option’s” reader’s choice award for “best burger” for 15 years running and “best chips” for 13 years running.
                <br><br>
                Steers is all about the burger and handmade chips. Aside from the wide range of beef, chicken and vegetarian burgers, together with the favourite king steer burger, one will also find that our menu has a wide range of other famous favourites, such as our flame-grilled basted ribs, hero steak rolls, creamy ice-creams and milkshakes.
                <br><br>
                We use only the freshest ingredients and classic taste combinations to make the best burgers in town. Just about everything we serve is made to order. The burger is at the heart of everything we do and is always 100% real.</p>

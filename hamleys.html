                <h1>HAMLEYS</h1>
                <p>Like chocolate for Mr Wonka, the toys Hamleys sells are the most important part of our business and we are committed to ensuring; our toys work as described, are safe for use and are sourced responsibly.
                <br><br>
                We believe, and it is our legal obligation to ensure, that the toys and child appealing products we sell, achieve the required international toy standards. This requirement means that the toys we sell will have been functionally and laboratory tested, to ensure they comply with the relevant Toy Safety Directives. We also require that toys for sale in Hamleys stores outside Europe meet necessary national requirements.
                <br><br>
                We want all of our customers, young and old, to be more than happy with the toys they are buying and aim for these toys to fulfil expectations â€“ always.</p>

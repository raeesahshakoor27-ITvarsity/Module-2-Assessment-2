                <h1>EXCLUSIVE BOOKS</h1>
                <p>Exclusive Books has a rich history – a colourful past of peaceful protest, fascinating stories and a family of staff, all boasting eclectic and wide-ranging knowledge. We are more than a store: we are a shared cultural touchpoint with personality and authority made possible through passion and an undying love of literature.
                <br><br>
                We opened our first store on King George Street in Johannesburg in 1951 and have since expanded to close to 50 stores with 1 in Botswana and one that can only be found in the sky – www.exclusivebooks.co.za. While we may be online, at heart we remain as we started out: a quirky local bookstore staffed by the keenest of readers and still crazy about books after all these years.</p>
